# Puto Island APK Build Instructions

## Problem Summary
Multiple GitHub Actions builds have failed due to Android SDK license acceptance issues that cannot be automated in CI/CD environments. The core issue is that Google requires interactive license acceptance that cannot be bypassed in automated builds.

## Current Status
✅ **Game Successfully Converted**: Pygame → Kivy  
✅ **Kivy Game Works**: Functional island management game  
❌ **APK Build**: Blocked by SDK licensing requirements  

## Solution: Local Build

Since automated builds are blocked by licensing, build the APK locally:

### Prerequisites
```bash
# macOS
brew install python3 openjdk@17
pip3 install buildozer cython kivy

# Linux/Ubuntu  
sudo apt install python3-pip openjdk-17-jdk
pip3 install buildozer cython kivy
```

### Build Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevinxuy/puto-island.git
   cd puto-island
   ```

2. **Accept Android SDK licenses** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   buildozer android debug
   # When prompted, type 'y' to accept all licenses
   ```

3. **Build the APK**:
   ```bash
   buildozer android debug
   ```

4. **Install on device**:
   ```bash
   adb install bin/*.apk
   ```

## Alternative: Use Prebuild Service

Consider using services like:
- **Buildozer Docker**: `docker run --rm -v $PWD:/app kivy/buildozer buildozer android debug`
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Run buildozer in a GitHub Codespace with manual license acceptance
- **Local VM**: Use Android Studio's emulator for testing
