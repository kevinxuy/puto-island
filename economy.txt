🎡 PRAYER WHEEL (zjt.py) GENERATION
- Base MP generation: 1 MP per full video cycle (7 seconds at V4)
- Temple level buff: +5% MP generation per temple level
- Total MP formula: Base_MP * (1 + 0.05 * average_temple_level)

⏱️ DAILY PRAYER REQUIREMENTS
- Building levels 0-4: 1 minute/day
- Building levels 5-9: 2 minutes/day  
- Building levels 10-19: 3 minutes/day
- Building levels 20-24: 4 minutes/day
- Building level 25: 5 minutes/day

MP CONSUMPTION
- Workers House: 2 MP/hour per house
- All other buildings: 0 MP/hour

🏝️ ISLAND LEVEL SYSTEM
================================

- Island Level = Minimum building level across all buildings
- Character spawn speed increase: 5% per island level
- Character movement speed increase: 5% per island level
- Display location: Top left corner of mainmap.py

📈 ECONOMY BALANCING NOTES
================================

1. EARLY GAME (Levels 1-5)
   - Players start with enough coins for 2-3 structure upgrades
   - MP is sufficient for 5 hours of Workers House operation
   - Focus on upgrading 1-2 buildings first

2. MID GAME (Levels 6-15)
   - Income starts compounding significantly
   - Prayer wheel time increases gradually
   - Need to balance worker capacity with building requirements

3. LATE GAME (Levels 16-25)
   - Massive income generation (10,000+ coins/hour possible)
   - Prayer requirements become significant (4-5 minutes/day)
   - Strategic choices about which buildings to max first

4. WORKER ECONOMY
   - Total workers needed at max: 40 (4 buildings × 10 workers)
   - One Workers House at level 1 provides 50 workers (sufficient)
   - Upgrading Workers House provides worker surplus for future buildings

5. UPGRADE STRATEGY TIPS
   - Temples: Steady, reliable income
   - Hotels: Higher base income, good mid-game choice
   - Restaurants: Highest growth rate, best late-game income
   - Workers House: Essential infrastructure, upgrade as needed

📊 TOTAL COST TO MAX ONE BUILDING (5 structures to level 5)
================================

🏛️ TEMPLE: ~563 coins total
🏨 HOTEL: ~1,156 coins total  
🍴 RESTAURANT: ~359 coins total
🏠 WORKERS HOUSE: ~184 coins total

Note: These are costs to get all 5 structures in one building to level 5 (the point where characters become satisfied). Maxing to level 25 would cost exponentially more.

💡 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
================================

1. All building income is calculated per hour but should be accumulated in real-time
2. MP consumption is also per hour but deducted in real-time
3. If MP reaches 0, all buildings stop generating income
4. Building levels in each location (T1, T2, H1, R1, A1) track the minimum structure level
5. The game should save state every time any value changes
6. Time-based calculations should account for time elapsed between game sessions
